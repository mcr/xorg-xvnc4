Description: Virtual network computing server software
 VNC stands for Virtual Network Computing. It is, in essence, a remote
 display system which allows you to view a computing `desktop' environment
 not only on the machine where it is running, but from anywhere on the
 Internet and from a wide variety of machine architectures.
 .
 This package provides a vncserver to which X clients can connect and the
 server generates a display that can be viewed with a vncviewer.
 .
 It contains an X server connector so clients can connect to your local X
 desktop directly.
 .
 Note: This server does not need a display. You need a vncviewer to see
 something. This viewer may also be on a computer running other operating
 systems.
